# 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-number-of-set-bits-in-binary-representation/description/)

### Review

Even though this problem is labeled easy, but it really made me think about constraints.
I realized after solving it that you only need to check prime numbers up to 20.
Since the maximum value is 10^6, we can estimate that it fits within 20 bits.
