# 696. Count Binary Substrings

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/description/)

### Review

I think continuity is important in this problem.
I first thought about counting even-sized windows, but it would take too long.
So, I decided to use consecutive numbers and focused on the point where the continuity breaks.
