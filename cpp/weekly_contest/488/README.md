### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Initial Participation (Weekly Contest):**:
  - I participated in my first Weekly Contest.
  - I realized I wasn't as prepared as I had hoped, leading to only two problems solved. However, I believe consistent practice will lead to steady improvement.
- **Post-Contest Analysis**:
  - Although I couldn't solve the third problem within the time limit, I followed up by solving it independently afterward.
  - I got to learn about the Sliding Window and Two Pointers techniques.
