# 3714. Longest Balanced Substring II

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-balanced-substring-ii/description/)

### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Struggling with Time Limits**:
  - Although the code passed when tested with long strings, I encountered a time limit exceeded error during the actual submission.
- **Deepening Data Structure Knowledge**:
  - I gained a better understanding of data structures while benchmarking execution times using various approaches.
- **Complexity from Optimization**:
  - Focusing too heavily on resolving the timeout issue led me to fragment the code, which inadvertently increased its complexity.
