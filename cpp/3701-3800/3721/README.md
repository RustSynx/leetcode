[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-balanced-subarray-ii/description/)

### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Encountering Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - This problem is identical to one I solved before, but the input size has increased, causing a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error with my previous algorithm.
- **Discovery of New Concepts**:
  - I learned about Segment Trees through this problem.
- **Future Practice Goals**:
  - I don’t feel like I’ve fully grasped the concept yet, so I plan to practice more until I’m comfortable with it.
