# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/)

### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Initial Approach (Deceptively Simple)**:
  - I initially implemented a simple sequential search, which led to a Time Limit Exceeded error.
  - I failed to account for the distinction between even and odd cases, which was a crucial part of the logic.
  - I underestimated the problem's complexity; what I thought would be a quick fix ended up taking much longer than anticipated.
