# 7. Reverse Integer

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)

### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Initial Approach (Current Status)**:
  - I am able to solve the problems, but my code doesn't feel like it's at a "coding test-ready" level yet.
  - While the logic works, the implementation lacks the conciseness and efficiency expected in a professional testing environment.
  - The implementation felt straightforward, though I prioritized functionality over performance during this phase.
- **Future Improvement (Action Plan)**:
  - I plan to get more practice by tackling a wider range of problems.
  - I will also make sure to test various cases before submitting my answers.
