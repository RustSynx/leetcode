# 6. Zigzag Conversion

[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/description/)

### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Initial Approach (Intuitive but Inefficient)**:
  - I initially attempted a solution using a highly intuitive approach.
  - While the efficiency was sub-optimal, it successfully passed all test cases.
  - The implementation felt straightforward, though I prioritized functionality over performance during this phase.
- **Future Improvement (Refactoring)**:
  - I plan to revisit this code later to optimize the performance.
  - Goal: I will refactor the current logic to improve efficiency and refine the algorithm into a more sophisticated structure.
