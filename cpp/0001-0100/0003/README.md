[Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Initial Approach (Intuitive Solution)**: The problem was straightforward to solve using an intuitive logic.
  - Since the solution came to mind immediately, I implemented it directly without overthinking the structure.
  - It was an "easy win" in terms of getting the correct answer, but this led to complacency regarding performance.

- **Future Improvement (Refactoring)**: The current performance is suboptimal.
  - If time permits, I plan to revisit this code to refactor the logic. 
  - Goal: My aim is to restructure the algorithm to boost performance (improve runtime) and achieve a better "Beats" score.
