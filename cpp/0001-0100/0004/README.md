### 💡 Approach & Retrospective

- **Initial Approach (Deceptively Simple)**: This problem felt deceptively simple—it seemed easy at first but turned out to be tricky.
  - The solution felt just out of reach (tantalizingly close), which led to a somewhat messy implementation as I tried various ideas to make it work.
  - My code ended up being a bit cluttered because I was writing it while struggling to grasp the core logic.

- **Future Improvement (Refactoring)**: Although the solution passed the test cases, the current code is not ideal.
  - I plan to revisit this later to review the logic. 
  - Goal: I need to refactor the messy code and refine the algorithm to make it cleaner and more structured.
